Flip Happens is a fast-paced platformer where you play as a stylish skater doing cool tricks and reacting fast through creative levels full of obstacles.

Your goal: collect all the letters (A, B, C, D...) in the correct alphabetical order – as fast as possible!

But watch out: you can only collect a letter if it's the correct next one. If you try to grab the wrong one, nothing happens. So every jump and grind counts – timing and awareness are super important!
